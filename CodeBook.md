Data description
========================================================

This codebook describes the dataset obtained by processing the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip with the **run_analysis.R** script from this repo.

Data processing steps are described in the **README.md** file.
